UTG Configuration Files
#######################

UTG makes use of 3 configuration files.

  1. ``config.ini`` - UTG Configuration file.
  2. ``dut_config.yaml`` - DUT Configuration file for test filtering.
  3. ``aliasing.yaml`` - File with alias for verilog signal names. (used
     when generating covergroups)

When specified, UTG also generates a ``test_list.yaml`` file along with the tests.

In this document, we try to explain the need to have these files as well throw 
some light on the format of these documents, so that the user can write/edit the
configuration file, as necessary.

============================
``config.ini`` Specification
============================

The ``config.ini`` file is used to specify the arguments required by UTG to 
generate tests. 

Configuration Options
---------------------

.. note:: Information about the ``dut_config.yaml``, ``aliasing.yaml`` and 
   ``test_list.yaml`` are provided in the following sections.

.. table:: General Configuration Options

  =================== =========================================================
  Parameter           Description
  =================== =========================================================
  verbose             The verbosity of the log generated by the tool.
  clean               [Boolean] Option to clean the files created duting test
                      generation. Clean will clean up all files, including the 
                      tests.
  modules             The Modules of the DUT for which you wish to generate the 
                      tests. (will take multiple values)
  module_dir          **Absolute** path to the directory where the user has 
                      saved the tests for all modules.
  work_dir            The workdir where all of the files, reports and logs are 
                      generated.
  linker_dir          The directory where the user has stored his ``link.ld`` file.
                      If not specified, UTG will generate a linker at the work_dir.
  dut_config          The **absolute** path to the ``dut_config.yaml`` file of 
                      the DUT for which the user wants to generate tests. 
  alias_file          The **absolute** path to the ``aliasing.yaml`` file of 
                      the DUT for which the user wants to generate covergroups.       
  gen_test_list       [Boolean] Creates a ``test_list.yaml`` file in the 
                      ``work_dir``.
  gen_test            [Boolean] UTG generates tests only when this is True. Else, 
                      UTG does nothing.
  val_test            [Boolean] When True, UTG will check the log generated from 
                      the DUT against known log patterns to obtain an intial 
                      report of test coverage.
  gen_cvg             [Boolean] When True, UTG will generate the covergroups for 
                      the tests.
  =================== =========================================================

.. note:: The standard delimiter for options having multiple values is **,**
    (comma).
